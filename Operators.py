#Assignment Operators

health = 50

# exactly the same as: health = health + 20
health -= 50
# exactly the same as: health = health - 50
# assignment operators can be combined with any of the arithmatic operators

# subtracting strings doesn't really makes sense
# not a lot of the other arithmatic operators works with strings
